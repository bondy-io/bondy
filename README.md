# Bondy

### The distributed application networking platform
Bondy is an open source, distributed, scaleable and robust networking platform for microservices and IoT applications written in Erlang. It implements the open Web Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP) offering both Publish and Subscribe (PubSub) and routed Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) comunication patterns.

## Documentation

For our work-in-progress documentation go to [http://docs.getbondy.io](http://docs.getbondy.io).

## Quick Start

### Docker
The fastest way to get started is by using our official docker images.

1. Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed and running.
2. Download the [examples/custom_config](https://github.com/Leapsight/bondy/tree/develop/examples/custom_config/etc) folder to a location of your choice, then `cd` to that location and run the following command (If you already cloned the Bondy repository then just `cd` to the location of the repo).


```shell
docker run \
--rm \
-e BONDY_ERL_NODENAME=bondy1@127.0.0.1 \
-e BONDY_ERL_DISTRIBUTED_COOKIE=bondy \
-u 0:1000 \
-p 18080:18080 \
-p 18081:18081 \
-p 18082:18082 \
-p 18083:18083 \
-p 18084:18084 \
-p 18085:18085 \
-v "$(PWD)/examples/custom_config/etc:/bondy/etc" \
-v "/tmp/data:/bondy/data" \
leapsight/bondy:master
```

### Building from source
#### Requirements

* [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/) 24 or later
* [Rebar3](https://rebar3.readme.io/) 3.17.0 or later
* openssl
* libssl
* [Libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium)
* libsnappy
* liblz4


#### Building

Clone this repository and `cd` to the location where you cloned it.

To generate a Bondy release to be used in production execute the following command which will generate a tarball containing the release at `$(PWD)/_build/prod/rel/`.

```shell
rebar3 as prod tar
```

Untar and copy the resulting tarball to the location where you want to install Bondy e.g. `~/tmp/bondy`.

```shell
tar -zxvf _build/prod/rel/bondy-1.0.0-beta.25.tar.qz -C ~/tmp/bondy
```

#### Running

To run Bondy, `cd` to the location where you installed it e.g. `~/tmp/bondy` and run the following command which will print all the options.

```shell
bin/bondy
```

For example, to run Bondy with output to stdout do

```shell
bin/bondy foreground
```

And to run Bondy with an interactive Erlang shell do

```shell
bin/bondy console
```

## Local cluster testing

### Run a first node

We will start a node named `bondy1@127.0.0.1` which uses the following variables from the config file (`config/test/node_1_vars.config`).

|Transport|Description|Port|
|---|---|---|
|HTTP|REST API GATEWAY|18080|
|HTTP|REST API GATEWAY|18083|
|HTTP|REST Admin API|18081|
|HTTPS|REST Admin API|18084|
|Websockets|WAMP|18080|
|TCP|WAMP Raw Socket|18082|
|TLS|WAMP Raw Socket|18085|


```bash
make node1
```

#### Create a Realm

WAMP is a session-based protocol. Each session belongs to a Realm.

```curl
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:18081/realms/" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -H 'Accept: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{
  "uri": "com.myrealm",
  "description": "My First Realm"
}'
```

#### Disable Security

We will disable security to avoid setting up credentials at this moment.

```curl
curl -X "DELETE" "http://localhost:18081/realms/com.myrealm/security_enabled" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -H 'Accept: application/json; charset=utf-8'
```

#### Run a second node

We start a second node named `bondy2@127.0.0.1` which uses the following variables from the config file (`config/test/node_2_vars.config`).

|Transport|Description|Port|
|:---|:---|:---|
|HTTP|REST API GATEWAY|18180|
|HTTP|REST API GATEWAY|18183|
|HTTP|REST Admin API|18181|
|HTTPS|REST Admin API|18184|
|Websockets|WAMP|18180|
|TCP|WAMP Raw Socket|18182|
|TLS|WAMP Raw Socket|18185|

```bash
make node2
```

After a minute the two nodes will automatically connect.
From now on all new Bondy control plane state changes will be propagated in real-time through broadcasting.
One minute after joining the cluster, the Active Anti-entropy service will trigger an exchange after which the Realm we have created in `bondy1@127.0.0.1` will have been replicated to `bondy2@127.0.0.1`.

### Run a third node

```bash
make node3
```
